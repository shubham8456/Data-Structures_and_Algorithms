### Resource(s) for recursion:

- Remember these key points as you practice:
  - Always identify the base case(s) that will terminate the recursion.
  - Ensure that your recursive calls move towards the base case to avoid infinite recursion.
  - Consider the space complexity of your recursive solutions, as deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.
  - Sometimes, an iterative solution might be more efficient than a recursive one. Learn to recognize when each approach is more appropriate.
- As you become more comfortable with recursion, youâ€™ll find that it becomes a valuable tool in your problem-solving toolkit. Many advanced algorithms and data structures, particularly those involving trees and graphs, rely heavily on recursive thinking.
